      <div> Secrets Found: </div>
    </header>

    <div><span class="redacted">Hilter</span> is still alive within <span class="secret">Argentina</span>. Or so the legend goes. Currently, though, there are sightings of a cryptid like individual who <span class="redacted">simply does not age</span>, and speaks in the <span class="secret">harshest of tongues<span>.</div>
    <br>
    <div><span class="redacted">Bush caused 9/11</span>, due to his interference in the 1980s in the Middle East. The <span class="secret">CIA</span> were the ones who <span class="redacted">provided weapons to the Taliban</span> in hopes of them driving out the Russian invaders. The plan backfired, and the <span class="redacted">rebel group</span> inevitably rebelled against <span class="redacted">their weapon supplier.</span></div>
    <br>
    <div>The United-States is currently a <span class="redacted">totalarian goverment</span>, and bound to fall into ruin. Trump was elected by people in hopes to bring peace to the United-States, but <span class="redacted">the reality of his election is far greater than simply 'peace'. Russia is the true culprit in the demise of the United-States. Their attempt is to bring down their oldest rival from within, rather than doing so by waging war.</span> It is easier to <span class="secret">bribe a country to ruin</span>, than to out produce and kill it.</div>
    <br>
    <div>The world has <span class="redacted">already ended and we currently exist within a collective dream state in an attempt to calm the mass populous, but the proletariat has become weary to the world around them.</span></div>
